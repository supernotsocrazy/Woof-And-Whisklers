			<h2>Our Goals at Woof And Whisker</h2>
			<p class="center">Our goal is to get every Woof and Whisker that we come accross to get a loving family that will give the animal a long happy life that they deserve. So we at Wolf and Whisker make it our mission to make sure when pairing a family with a dog that the family  is fully prepared for the responsability as well as making sure that they can become a perfect family to support each other.</p>
