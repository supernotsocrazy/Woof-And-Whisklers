					<h2>How do you donate&#63;</h2>
					<p>While we do prefer you come in to donate so we can personally thank you and understand what you hope<br> this money will do for us. We do offer other ways of donating our other prefered method is sending a<br> check if you have an issue with that please call <a href="tel:212-555-2368">(212)-555-2368</a> with any concerns or questions.</p>
			
					<h2>Why should you donate&#63;</h2>
					<p> We do not require any donations from anyone but they are much abliged as it enables us to improve<br> the quality of life that our woof and whiskers have while waiting for the right family. So donating<br> can help out other animals that may not get adopted right away still have a happy long life.</p>
					
					<h2>Don't want to or lack the funds to donate but still wanna help out&#63;</h2>
					<p>We do not ask for donations but are much appreciated and do not wish for anyone to donate if they can not.<br> but if you desire to assist us in our mission you can foster which can help the animals aclimate to different enviroment.</p>
